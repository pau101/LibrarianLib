# LibrarianLib

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TeamWizardry/LibrarianLib.svg?branch=1.11)](https://travis-ci.org/TeamWizardry/LibrarianLib)

## [Documentation WIP](http://teamwizardry.com/docs)

LibrarianLib is the library mod to end all library mods. It doesn't attempt to do much else than take the pain out of modding. It can handle a great deal of boilerplate code that you really shouldn't have to touch. Its largest components are an automatic serialization system, automatic model creation and registration, a powerful GUI library that takes out the magic numbers and complex control stuctures by making everything modular, and a powerful and flexable particle system.

LibrarianLib depends on [Shadowfacts' Forgelin](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/shadowfacts-forgelin). Make sure you have it if you want to use it.
